For all your github learning needs

# Before beginning

- Be sure to mention relevent experience you have with github in industry, highlighting the important of using a version control software throughout, giving reasons why each part is useful and how in day to day work as a developer.

# The Basics

## What is Github?

- version control system
- saves your stuff and tracks changes you make
- protects you from losing code
- helps make code collaboration easier
- central place to store and retrieve code projects
- great thing to have on your resume

## What you'll need to get started

- Make a github account on github.com
  - Use your school email for a free pro account
- install git
  - might need to be on a usb stick in the labs
- install github desktop
  - Machines should install it on their machines soon after they login
  - login to github desktop
- optionally use gitbash instead

## Making your first repository

- Make it on github.com
- Name it something relevant to class like WEB315S22
- set it as private initially
- add a readme.md by default
- ignore license

## Cloning your repository

- go to file - settings
- login (will open browser and login that way)
- Click clone repository
- Find your repository on the list
- Choose folder it should go into
- After cloning, view it in file explorer to see it locally on the machine
  - need them to understand that changes made to files in this folder will show up as pending changes to github

## Local vs origin

- Explain difference between local repository and remote repository (origin)

## Making your first commit

- make changes to readme file
- show that they are pending until you commit them
- commit changes locally, setting a relevant name for the summary
- description optional for now
- emphasize that commit didn't make it to github.com yet because we didn't push
  - changes can't be marked unless they are PUSHED
## Fetch, push and pull

- Push change so it's on github now
- View on github to see changes
- potentially make changes to file on github so you can then fetch on github desktop and pull changes

## Browsing the commit history

- make a few more commits and then view history on github desktop and github.com
- draw attention to time stamps, files changes, different views for commit history on github.com, etc
- also emphasize that code is never lost, you can always recover things in the github commit history
## Making and publishing branches

- Make a branch off main
- Make commits and push them, to show it doens't affect main branch
- change branches on github.com to show where changes exist

## Switching Branches

- Show how to switch branches locally on github desktop
- Show what happens when you switch branches with pending changes 
  - stash changes vs bring them with you
- Higlight that your local copy of the repo only contains the copy of the files based on the current branch that is checked out
- make sure they understand that making a branch is based on the branch you're currently in, or main, depending on what branch you're currently in

# Extra Items

## Making commits directly on github.com

- Higlight the idea of being able to make commits directly on website
- make sure they understand that they can't easily make folders there
  - uploading complex project code should be done in github desktop
  - minor tweaks can be done on github.com directly
- show file histories

## Inviting people to collaborate

- have them invite you to their repository, so you can view it
  - private repos protect them from potential academic integrity issues coming up later
  - You need to accept invites once they invite you, can be done later
- Discuss permission possibilities and how awesome it is that you can invite collaborators for projects in industry

## Repository settings

- Here they can change privacy levels, archive repository, delete repository, etc.

## Creating pull requests

- Show what a pull request is and how it works
- potentially use this for assignments, where they submit pull requests (optional idea)

## Deployment

- tbd

## GitBash

- tbd
## Github and VSCode

- tbd
